                                    Yo, Bretheren. 

                                    This template is made by me, with the intention of providing people who are starting out in web development
                                    with a simplistic, minimal website to get themselves up online and displaying their projects.

                                    You will find that every section is commented and explains in brief what it does.

                                    It was created out of the goodness of my heart. <3

                                    By all means use this for your own projects, pull it apart, edit it.. claim it as your own work if you want to. However
                                    I please ask you don't resell it.

                                    If you do, I will find you.. and I will kill you.

                                    Slowly.

									                  Have a splendid day.
                                    James x

           <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> BRANDING Ugly Buttr is an all-natural body product line made from goats milk. The packaging was designed to stand out on the shelves from the standard green/cream style in all-natural products. It was designed to be inviting and playful to draw in a younger audience.

           <p class='hidden popUpdesc'> BRANDING This packaging was designed to reference the woodcut style of traditional Mexican art but with a modern and minimalist twist. Many tequilas focus on the history of tequila, but this brand is focused on the agave plant and farming process, so the packaging nods to the agave plant and the landscape it is farmed on.
